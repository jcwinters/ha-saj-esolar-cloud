# SAJ eSolar Cloud Integration for Home Assistant

A Home Assistant integration for SAJ eSolar cloud service, focused on H1 inverters with battery storage.

This integration is a complete rewrite focused on H1 inverters with battery storage, using the cloud API. The "Cloud" suffix denotes its cloud-based nature and distinguishes it from other SAJ eSolar integrations.

## Features

- Configuration through Home Assistant UI
- Comprehensive monitoring of:
  - Solar generation (current, daily, monthly, yearly, total)
  - Battery status (level, power, current, capacity)
  - Grid interaction (import/export)
  - Power flow directions
  - Environmental impact (CO₂ reduction, trees planted equivalent)
- All sensors properly organized under a single device entity
- Automatic data updates every 5 minutes

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots menu in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/jcwinters/ha-saj-esolar-cloud`
6. Select category: "Integration"
7. Click "Add"
8. Find "SAJ eSolar Cloud" in the integrations list and install it
9. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/saj_esolar_cloud` directory to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to Home Assistant's Configuration > Integrations
2. Click the "+ Add Integration" button
3. Search for "SAJ eSolar Cloud"
4. Enter your eSolar Portal credentials:
